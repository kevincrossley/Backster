When you make a change to any of this code, when reuploading, commit changes as a new branch, not as the master. Only merge with the master when the new version is bug-free and completely ready to replace the old version

# Python & Arduino Code
# Use Backster5v2.py raw_data5.ino

## Matlab Code Instructions
Current MATLAB code setup requires DataViz.m, ExScriptFun.m, eulerT.m, and the supporting files found in the current matlab folder in Code on the shared drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzI_iQd0f15xMGt5TkV1ZkRWSDA

## Arduino Code with matlab
Use GetData_KC, which is an implementation of Elyse's fixed / reliable Arduino code that outputs 46 item line of a time stamp and all data for the 5 sensors. Requires libraries found at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BzI_iQd0f15xQWhNdUJOYXJ3UzA
